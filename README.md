# Stax-Overflow

Objective: Build a StackOverflow clone in three days using a Ruby & Sinatra back-end with AJAX front-end

On Tuesday, we learned how to use AJAX for our web applications and our assignment was due on Friday.  This gave us two and a half days to build a sinatra application, and AJAX our front-end.  By the end of the first day, we had MVP status - we generated our models and our migrations (with polymorphic associations), and launched our website.  The second day was spent doing bug fixes, CSS, and merge conflicts.  Our final day was spend AJAX-ing the ability to add questions, comments, and votes.  Although our project isn't perfect, it was a great learning experience and through it, we learned best practices for creating vertical silos in web production, avoiding merge conflicts, the importance of communication in teams, and implementing AJAX in a sinatra application.
